## google colab
[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free, jupyter notebook like online software. The most fancy part of Google colab is that it works pretty much as same as the jupyter notebook in local service. It aslo offers a free Telsa T4(Sep.19, the free GPU may change based on the update by google :) ) for each user, which is pretty much enough in some small deeping learning problem. 

The eaiser way to upload the data or download data is directly from google drive, simply type in the code below.
```{python}
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
